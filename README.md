# 🌍 Bangalore Environmental Change Analysis (2014 - 2022)
### 📍 Case Study using Remote Sensing & GIS

## 📌 Project Overview
This study analyzes the land-use and land-cover (LULC) transformations in Bangalore. By utilizing multi-temporal satellite imagery, the project quantifies the impact of rapid urbanization on vegetation health and spatial patterns.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
* **Spatio-temporal Analysis:** Tracing landscape evolution over a 9-year span.
* **Vegetation Monitoring:** Quantifying plant health using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
* **LULC Classification:** Categorizing zones into urban (built-up), agricultural, and forested areas.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Data
* **Tools:** ArcGIS, Remote Sensing & GIS Spatial Analysis.
* **Satellite Data:** Landsat 8 (OLI & TIRS Sensors).
* **Core Metrics:** NDVI calculation using Band 4 (Red) and Band 5 (Near-Infrared).

### 📐 Formula
The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is calculated as:
$$NDVI = \frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red}$$

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition:** Obtained Landsat 8 imagery for hotter months (March/April) to minimize seasonal variance.
2. **Preprocessing:** Conducted layer stacking and atmospheric correction for spectral bands.
3. **Index Calculation:** Applied NDVI to distinguish between dense vegetation and built-up areas.

## 📈 Results & Insights
* **Urban expansion:** Significant growth in built-up areas (red regions) was identified from 2014 to 2022.
* **Ecological Impact:** A corresponding decline in dense vegetation cover was observed, highlighting environmental shifts.
